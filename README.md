A background to my professional experience in the construction industry and how data science is becoming a skill to have in order to increase efficiency

In this new age of data collection and analytics from IoT devices data scientist are indispensible in The Built Environment.

Imagine a bridge connected to devices uses sensors that detect motion and thus can be used to collect data on traffic passing on the bridge. This data through IoT can be used to better design for bridges to last longer and schedule for future maintenance.
